# Plotly Raincloud Plot - Tutorial
CMSE402 SS25 Honors Option -- Plotly Raincloud Plot Tutorial

In this repository I have a Jupyter Notebook that has a tutorial of how to make a raincloud plot using Plotly. The dataset used is the publicly accessible Palmer Penguin dataset, and can be applied to other datasets as well.

Please see the image in the repository for what the finished vizualization looks like!
